# Hero-Escape-Game
This was the final project for my CSC 2110 class. Created a simple, interactive game command-line game where a player moves a character (hero) through multiple rooms to get to the exit. In some of the rooms, the hero may find other characters (monsters) and items. The hero will battle the enemies and take the times. 

The player wins when the hero reaches the exit. 

The player loses when the hero's health points (HP are zero (0).
